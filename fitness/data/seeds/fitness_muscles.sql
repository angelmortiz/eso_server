It''s composed of two parts or ''heads'' - a long head and a short head, which work together to control the motion of both the shoulder and elbow joints.\nPrimarily, the biceps is responsible for elbow flexion (bending your arm), forearm supination (rotating your forearm to turn your palm upwards), and to a lesser degree, shoulder flexion (raising your arm).'),

Its main functions include flexion, adduction (moving the arm toward the body), and internal rotation of the shoulder. This muscle plays a vital role in actions like pushing and pressing, and is a key muscle worked in exercises like push-ups and bench press.'),

The lateral deltoids aid in lifting the arm out to the side (abduction). The posterior deltoids assist in lifting the arm backward (extension) and rotating it outward (external rotation).'),
